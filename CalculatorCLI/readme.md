# Exercise - CLI Calculator

## Requirements
- [Python >= 3.10.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Assignment Introduction

You have been tasked to design and implement a program that will perform some basic arithmetic calculations.

## System Requirements

- Your program should present the user with a menu that contains all the operations that the user will be allowed to perform. These options are: 
  - Addition (of n numbers)  
  - Subtraction (only two inputs)  
  - Multiplication (of n numbers)  
  - Division (only two inputs)  
  - Close the program  
- Then the program should allow the user to select any of the operations from the menu. 
- For addition and multiplication, the program should ask the user how many numbers they want to add/multiply. Depending on this input, then the program should allow the user to type in, one by one, the elements of the operation. 
- In the case of subtraction and division, the program should allow the user to type in, one by one, the two elements of the operation. 
- Once the user has completed the corresponding inputs, the result of the operation should be displayed, followed by the original menu. 
- The program should allow the user to perform multiple operations without having to run the program again. 
- At every stage of the program, for every user input, validations must be implemented. 
- If the last option is selected, the program should finish. 
- Your source code must be properly commented, and a reasonable explanation of your logic should be included. This explanation can be short and simple, but clear enough to demonstrate your understanding of your own code. 

## Notes

- Your program should make use of different data structures to store inputs/outputs as needed. As well as loops (for and/or while) and flow control structures. 
- Using multiple functions is recommended to organise your code and avoid repetition. 
- Keep in mind that dividing any number by zero is not mathematically possible -so you should validate against it. 

## Tools Used
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): [`Python`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
